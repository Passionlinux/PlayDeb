 Pau,
 .
 That is a little odd to claim it can't be modified. The whole point of
 making it free is so that developers can do anything they want with it.
 Somebody is adding more to what free means than what free means.
 .
 The code is totally free, with no restrictions on it whatsoever. There are
 no fees, no requirements to provide changes back to me, etc., and of course
 people can modify it. It would not be free if they couldn't. (And many
 people have. It's used in lots of projects, some free and some commercial.)
 .
 I inserted the "Freeware Public License" line to poke fun at the GNU Public
 License, which really is encumbered by silly restrictions. My code has
 absolutely no restrictions whatsoever.
 .
 You are hereby authorized to make any change you want to the license file
 or even adapt it as you see fit to address your own concerns. When I say it
 is free, I mean it really is free :-)
 .
 Paul
