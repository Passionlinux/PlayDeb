spring (96.0+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  New datadir structure for spring. All data will be written to
  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME (~/.config/spring) and the default config file is
  ~/.config/spring/springsettings.cfg from now on. All settings from the old
  layout will be read, but the engine will write them to the new location.
  Please refer to the upstream changelog for more information and to this
  official thread. http://springrts.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=30044
