freeciv (2.5.1-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    * Fixes to longstanding bugs in border rules:
    + Once a city has claimed a tile within its workable radius,
      that tile cannot be stolen by another nation. (This had been
      broken since 2.3; now the behavior reflects the
      documentation.) GNA#23501
    + Water tiles next to cities and other border sources could
      sometimes remain unclaimed, semi-randomly. Now they are always
      claimed. Update the help to accurately reflect the rules.
      (This had not been working as intended since at least 2.1.)
      GNA#23503 GNAPATCH#5987
    * Angry citizens had been accidentally disabled since 2.4. With most
      supplied rulesets and governments, these were supposed to appear
      when an empire had so many cities that there were no content
      citizens left to become unhappy; now they do. This may
      substantially increase unhappiness in very large empires, even in
      ongoing games. Angry citizens can be disabled by editing the
      ruleset. GNA#23743
    * Fixes to corner cases in the civ2civ3 rules:
    + Ending a turn on Mountains no longer gives a movement penalty
      if the tile has a road. GNAPATCH#6014
    + Prevent building farmland on bare desert terrain, since it
      will provide no bonus. GNA#23609
    + City center tiles benefiting from an automatic farmland bonus
      no longer get the trade bonus from Super Highways, as with
      other farmland tiles. GNA#23610
    * The client could sometimes fail to show some cargo of a transport
      in the unit selection dialog, due to the server not sending correct
      information after reloading a savegame. Thus transports could
      appear to have spare capacity when they didn't. GNA#23444
    * Fix some bugs with unique units (such as Leaders):
    + Actions that transfer units between players didn't have
      sufficient checks. For instance, you could give away a city
      containing your Leader, giving you no Leader and the recipient
      two. (You could then attack the city, losing the recipient the
      game.) GNA#23578 GNA#23691
    + With gameloss_style="Loot" (not in any of the supplied
      rulesets), dying Leader units could be transferred or revealed
      to the conqueror, causing trouble such as the conqueror then
      losing the game. GNA#23676 GNA#23684
    * Maps could be generated with rivers on ocean tiles in some cases.
      GNA#23576
    * When the AI proposed a treaty, it could be sent in such a way as to
      cause the client to pop it up in front of other tabs, obscuring
      end-of-turn activities. GNA#23565
    * Prevent creating and canceling treaties in ways that should be
      illegal between members of the same team (such as withdrawing
      vision), and generally improve checking for illegal pacts.
      GNA#22993 GNA#23421 GNA#23408
    * Fix a corner case where a technology could be granted to a dead
      player due to changing research costs. GNA#23437
    * Fix a possible crash after an air unit automatically returns to
      safety to avoid running out of fuel. GNA#23728
    * Fix a cause of the error message "Trying to update old city",
      although the circumstances and consequences of this bug are
      unclear. GNA#23716
    * Give a reason when failing to create as many AI players as
      requested. (For instance, due to the currently selected nation set
      not having enough nations; the default 'core' set limits games to
      50 players, but more can be created by switching to the extended
      nation set.) GNA#23526 GNA#23621
    * The 'first_timeout' option was broken in various ways. Notably,
      setting it to 0 in pregame caused the first turn to have an
      immediate timeout rather than no timeout; setting 'timeout' or
      'first_timeout' during the first turn could do the wrong thing; and
      the client display of time remaining was incorrect for the first
      turn. GNA#23324 GNA#23724

    Changes affecting other rulesets / modders

    * Fix a server crash in rulesets with variable city map radius. This
      could manifest for instance if city radius depends on government.
      GNA#23591
    * An AI with an 'expansionist' trait value less than the default
      never built settlers. GNA#23745
    * AI trait settings modified by Lua script were not correctly loaded
      from savefiles. They were saved correctly, so pre-existing
      savefiles are now loaded correctly. GNA#23564
    * Fix a few remaining cases where a negative value for a boolean
      effect would erroneously enable it: 'No_Diplomacy' and
      'Happiness_To_Gold'. GNA#23364
    * Units' ability to transform terrain is now documented
      automatically. (Supplied rulesets have been updated to reflect
      this, but add-on rulesets may need tweaking.) GNAPATCH#5981
      GNAPATCH#5982
    * Nations without legend text no longer crash the server. GNA#20110
    * Add and improve load-time checks for errors in rulesets and
      tilesets. GNAPATCH#5892 GNAPATCH#5918 GNAPATCH#5985 GNA#23299
    * Update included Lua to 5.2.4. GNAPATCH#5939

    Changes affecting server operators

    * Delegation is now correctly case-insensitive with respect to
      usernames. GNA#21744

    General

    * In a sequence of unit orders, a unit move that exhausts movement
      points no longer necessarily prevents the next order from occurring
      in the same turn. (But there are currently no go-to-and-do actions
      available to players that do not require movement points to do the
      action, so this has no visible effect.) GNA#23594
    * Memory leak fixes. GNAPATCH#5808 GNAPATCH#5946 GNAPATCH#5989
      GNAPATCH#6030 GNAPATCH#6090 GNAPATCH#6093 GNAPATCH#6140
      GNAPATCH#6169 GNAPATCH#6170
    * Various internal changes which should only affect developers.
      GNAPATCH#6012 GNA#23285 GNA#23703 GNAPATCH#6179

    AI

    * The AI overestimated the loss of trade from canceling an old trade
      route when deciding whether to create a new one. GNA#23532
    * The AI may be less likely to abandon its units once loaded onto
      allied transports (including those owned by human players).
      GNAPATCH#6181
    * In the civ2civ3 ruleset, the Cheating AI now gets its cheating
      defense bonus applied on top of the bonus from fortresses and
      airbases. GNA#23370
    * The AI no longer asks to sign a ceasefire if circumstances prevent
      signing any treaty. GNA#23542

    Clients

    * In terrain info popups, show the countdown to armistice expiry as
      well as for ceasefire. GNA#23303
    * The city dialog 'Happiness' tab now shows better how changes to the
      number of cities will affect happiness. GNA#23611
    * When the Nations report is sorted by diplomatic status, it is now
      ordered by friendliness rather than alphabetically. GNA#23420
    * The city footprint outline for settler units is now drawn even if
      the map grid is enabled. GNA#23302
    * The front part of bases such as fortresses could fail to be drawn
      if they were on unowned territory. GNA#23418
    * The middle-click popup now shows unit nationality if different from
      its owner. Fix cosmetic issues with display of unit nationality in
      other contexts. GNA#23740
    * Fixes to the 'Turn Done' button behaviour in games with alternating
      turns:
    + The button could be sensitive on first connection even when it
      was not your turn. GNA#21633
    + The button no longer constantly blinks, in clients where
      blinking is supported. GNA#23733
    * Minor improvements to robustness and diagnostics of LAN game
      announcements. GNA#23319 GNAPATCH#5865
    * (Gtk) Add a confirmation when canceling a treaty from the Nations
      report. GNA#23411
    * (Gtk) Prevent the main map window layout jumping about when
      switching between unit stacks of different sizes. (This was
      particularly noticeable with hex tilesets.) GNA#23562
    * (Gtk) Various minor cosmetic changes. GNA#23563 GNA#22676
      GNAPATCH#5957 GNA#22836 GNA#22677
    * (Qt) Add "Establish Trade Route" to menus. GNAPATCH#6054
    * (Qt) Help claimed that mining produced food rather than shields;
      also other typo fixes and text tweaks. GNA#23284 GNA#23282
      GNA#23304 GNA#23557
    * (Qt) Fix a crash when the attached player is under AI control and
      receives a diplomatic meeting request. GNA#23626
    * (SDL) Rulesets with specialists other than the traditional
      entertainer / tax collector / scientist set are now supported.
      GNAPATCH#5868
    * (SDL) Fix a crash and other trouble when changing to a different
      player mid-game. GNA#23540 GNA#23551
    * (SDL) Observers are no longer invited to end their turn. GNA#17703
    * (SDL) After leaving a game, the unit orders icons could remain
      on-screen. GNA#23357
    * (SDL) When a spy sabotaged a specific building, the dialog for
      choosing that building could remain. GNA#23296
    * (Gtk3) When run on a very small screen, the city dialog now has
      more tabs each with less content, to try to fit. GNAPATCH#5958
    * (Gtk3) Map in city dialog is now greyed out when under governor
      control, as for other clients. GNA#22834

    Tools

    * Add confirmation when quitting the Qt modpack installer.
      GNAPATCH#6042
    * Improve quit confirmation message. GNAPATCH#6052 GNA#23571
    * The Qt modpack installer window is now resizeable. GNA#23193

    Tilesets / Art

    * Added graphics for maglev, inaccessible terrain, and unit costs up
      to 9 to all of the isotrident, isophex, and hex2t tilesets. All
      supplied tilesets now have these graphics. GNAPATCH#5962
      GNAPATCH#5972 GNAPATCH#5980
    * Update Maglev art in the Amplio2 and Cimpletoon tilesets.
      GNAPATCH#5756

    Help / Documentation

    * Document that bombardment (as used by e.g. civ2civ3
      helicopters/bombers) damages all units on a tile. GNAPATCH#5822
    * Help for ruleset items more thoroughly documents what other items
      they enable:
    + Buildings enabled by extras (such as "Aqueduct, River" in
      civ2civ3) and nations. GNAPATCH#5984
    + Governments enabled by technologies and nations. GNAPATCH#5813
    + Road types enabled by technologies. GNA#23281
    * Corrections to civ2civ3 ruleset documentation to reflect the actual
      rules:
    + Document the weaknesses of Big Land units (move restrictions
      and indefensibility). GNAPATCH#5823
    + Quantify the work bonus of veteran Engineers. GNAPATCH#5857
    + Nuclear fallout can be generated on oceans, and cleared by
      Transports. GNA#23388 GNA#23428
    + Migrants can clear fallout and build fortresses. GNA#23362
    * Miscellaneous improvements to in-game text and user documentation.
      GNAPATCH#5858 GNA#23346 GNA#23427 GNA#22454 GNAPATCH#5965
      GNAPATCH#5990 GNAPATCH#5988 GNAPATCH#5986 GNA#23397 GNA#23586
      GNA#23263 GNAPATCH#5952 GNAPATCH#6189
    * Miscellaneous changes to developer/ruleset docs. GNA#23391
      GNAPATCH#5948 GNAPATCH#6024 GNA#23783
    * Invisible changes to assist localization. GNA#23333 GNAPATCH#5960
      GNAPATCH#5880 GNA#23539 GNA#23443 GNAPATCH#5838

    Translations

    * Updated translations:
    + Complete translations: Spanish, French, British English.
    + Incomplete translations: Finnish (100% core, 87% nations),
      German (100% core, 87% nations), Catalan (99.8% core, 100%
      nations), Polish (97.2% core, 100% nations).

    Build/portability

    * Improvements to configure's Qt detection:
    + Make configure checks suitable for Mac OS X. Add new configure
      option --with-qt5-framework-bin. GNA#18200
    + Search in /usr/lib/qt and /usr/include/qt (the latter is
      required for Arch Linux). GNAPATCH#5919
    + If a Qt installation is explicitly specified with
      --with-qt5-includes / --with-qt5-libs, don't look elsewhere.
      GNA#23348
    * Fix compilation of the Qt client with --disable-nls. GNA#23415
    * If the user does not specify a client, configure now prefers
      building the Qt client to the SDL or Xaw clients. GNAPATCH#6050
    * Fix clang warnings. Freeciv can now be built warning-clean with
      clang-3.7. GNA#23483
    * Look harder for a nullptr definition; fixes warnings from clang on
      Mac OS X. GNA#23414
    * Fix some warnings from GCC 5 and cppcheck. Freeciv can now be built
      warning-clean with gcc-5.1. GNAPATCH#5994 GNAPATCH#6092
    * Check for __VA_ARGS__ handling at configure time, giving a less
      obscure error when attempting to use a compiler that does not
      implement the behavior we rely on (such as tcc). GNAPATCH#6033
    * Compressed scenarios no longer embed a timestamp, fixing a
      complaint from reproducible-builds infrastructure such as Debian's.
      GNAPATCH#6175
    * Fix failure to compile when Postgres support was enabled. GNA#23549
    * Minor corrections to .desktop files. GNAPATCH#5938 GNAPATCH#5940

  * Drop the following patches. They were merged upstream.
    - BindAll.patch
    - add-keywords-to-desktop-files.patch
    - empty-governments.patch
  * Drop increase_minimum_citydlg.patch and use upstream values again.

freeciv (2.4.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Make gtk2-engines-pixbuf a full dependency of freeciv-client-gtk since it
    is required to display GTK-2 themes properly. (Closes: #765501)
  * Add empty-governments.patch.
    Fix empty government list in menu (backport of upstream SVN commit 26427).
    Ensure the menus are really created before performing any operations on
    them. Thanks to Rogier for the report. (Closes: #764706)
  * Add BindAll.patch.
    Fix socket binding and ensure that the client is always able to connect to
    local servers.
    Thanks to Xavier Cartron for the report and Jacob Nevins for the patch.
    (Closes: #757876)
  * Rename file extensions of patches from diff to patch.
  * Update Vcs-Browser field to new canonical address.
  * freeciv-client-gtk: Clarify in the package description that the GTK+ 3
    client is still in an experimental state and that it is recommended to use
    the GTK+ 2 version instead.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Mon, 20 Oct 2014 13:18:45 +0200

freeciv (2.4.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Ensure that Freeciv can be built twice in a row.
    debian/rules: Copy mkinstalldirs script to bootstrap directory because it
    is removed when the build system is autoreconfigured for the second time.
    This prevents a FTBFS in subsequent runs. (Closes: #764116)
  * Build gtk2, gtk3, sdl, xaw and stub clients explicitly.
    Change configure option --enable-client=all to
    --enable-client=gtk2,gtk3,sdl,xaw,stub to ensure that the qt client is not
    built by accident in a non-clean build environment. (Closes: #764114)
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 3.9.6.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Mon, 06 Oct 2014 01:20:14 +0200

freeciv (2.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Imported Upstream version 2.4.3.
  * Remove autotools_dev. Build only with dh_autoreconf.

freeciv (2.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Imported Upstream version 2.4.2.
  * debian/control:
    - Remove alternative dependencies on fonts-japanese-gothic and
      fonts-vlgothic since the former package does not exist and the latter was
      actually never used.
    - Change -data package dependency to freeciv-data (= ${source:Version}).
      This is a simpler expression that does apparently the same as using an >=
      and <= expression.
  * Update themes_sdl_use_system_fonts.diff. Use the correct paths to system
    font files.
  * freeciv-data: Install appdata files to /usr/share/appdata.
  * Add Forwarded header to add-keywords-to-desktop-files.patch.

 -- Markus Koschany <apo@gambaru.de>  Wed, 12 Feb 2014 17:02:14 +0100

freeciv (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Imported Upstream version 2.4.1. (Closes: #730868)
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Update debian/copyright to copyright format 1.0.
    - Add missing Expat and fonts licenses.
  * Bump compat level to 9 and require debhelper >= 9.
  * Improve the package description of Freeciv's clients. (Closes: #657195)
    (LP: #202327)
  * Add menu icon to menu files.
    - Add imagemagick to Build-Depends-Indep. Convert icons in
      dh_auto_build-indep target. Add icon entry to menu files. Clean xpm files
      in debian/rules. (Closes: #726221)
  * Ensure the package can be built. Do not remove hidden quilt .pc directory
    in dh_clean. (Closes: #598226)
  * debian/rules:
    - Build with --parallel.
    - Use dh_auto_configure instead of configure command and pass dpkg's
      buildflags via dh_auto_configure to the build system.
    - Use MULTIARCH paths due to compat level 9 and remove *.la and *.a files
      in multiarch library paths.
    - Use --enable-sys-lua configure option.
      Build with Debian's system lua libraries instead of the embedded ones.
    - Do not export DH_VERBOSE=1. Disable DH's verbose build.
    - Export DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS = hardening=+all.
      Enable all hardening flags since freeciv is a network and multiplayer
      game thus it benefits greatly from additional security features.
    - Verbose build. Use --disable-silent-rules. Don't hide possible compiler
      warnings.
    - Export DEB_LDFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND = -Wl,--as-needed. Avoid useless
      dependencies.
  * Declare compliance with Debian policy 3.9.5.
  * debian/control:
    - Use canonical VCS-fields.
    - Add libtolua-dev and libtolua++5-1-dev to Build-Depends.
    - Remove versioned build-dependency on dpkg (>= 1.15.7).
      It is trivially satisfied.
    - Tighten dependency on freeciv-data. Use
      freeciv-data (>= ${source:Upstream-Version}),
      freeciv-data (<= ${source:Version}),
    - Replace versioned dependencies on freeciv-server with ${binary:Version}
      substvar. Use a substvar instead of changing the versioned dependency
      every time by hand.
  * wrap-and-sort -sab
  * Update debian/watch. Detect only stable releases.
  * Drop freeciv-data.NEWS. It refers to an obsolete version of freeciv.
  * Remove debian/tmp from install files. Not needed.
  * Drop use_system_m4.diff. The patch was never complete.
  * Install all documentation in doc subdirectory.
    - Update freeciv-data.docs and install all documentation except the
      Makefiles, man pages and INSTALL files.
  * Link freeciv-gtk3.6 to freeciv-client.6. Both gtk clients share the same
    information.
  * New: add-keywords-to-desktop-files.patch.
  * Install upstream freeciv-sdl.desktop file.
  * freeciv-data.README.Debian. Remove obsolete notes about Xaw3D.
  * Drop README.source. Hardening is fully implemented now.

  * Make the SDL client depend on ttf-dejavu-core, ttf-sazanami-gothic,
    ttf-unfonts and ttf-arphic-uming, and remove the font files from the
    -data package, which had grown in size way too much in 2.1.x. For now,
    Recommends or Suggests can't be used as the client won't start at all
    if the fonts listed in the themespec are missing.
  * New patch patches/themes_sdl_use_system_fonts.diff, to make the themespec
    reference the system-wide Debian fonts for the SDL client.

    differently in ggz.m4.

freeciv (2.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Remove all common ggz configure flags now that ggz.m4 appears to
    be fixed upstream, and the correct path should be autodetected.
  * Pass --without-ggz-client to the sdl and xaw3d targets, as advised
    by upstream, as GGZ support in these clients is untested or incomplete.
    This removes unnecessary dependencies and leaves GTK+ as the only
    GGZ-capable client.
    Also, pass --without-ggz-server to the clients, and --without-ggz-client
    to the server.
  * Pass --enable-noregistry to avoid GGZ module registration on install.
  * Remove links file for -sound-standard, as it doesn't depend on -data
    and therefore docs can't be shared.
  * Build-Depend on x11proto-core-dev, not x-dev.
  * Require libggz* (>= 0.0.14) as per configure.in (closes: #450761).
  * Wrap build-depends.
  * Remove XS- prefixes to Vcs-Browser and Vcs-Svn control fields.
  * Install civclient.dsc in /usr/share/ggz/modules/freeciv, not /etc/ggz;
    modify postinst/preinst accordingly.
  * Update data_Makefile_use_sysconfdir.diff and data_dsc_use_bindir.diff.
  * Remove debian/patches/gtk_cma_gcc42.diff, not really needed according to
    Jason.
  * Remove a note about the old package reorganisation from README.Debian,
    as the information isn't useful or accurate anymore (closes: 403858).
  * Don't install our own .desktop file for -client-gtk, as Freeciv now
    ships one based on ours. Purposely don't ship freeciv-server.desktop,
    I don't think it should exist at all.
  * Move icons dir to the correct directory, and install it in -data.
  * Don't ship our own .png icons, so the freedesktop icons can be used
    instead. Hence, drop Build-Dep on sharutils. It'd be great if someone
    would provide xpm icons based on the official ones. :)

freeciv (1.14.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Major package reorganization:
    - adopt a naming scheme for freeciv packages: freeciv-mod-* for mod
      packages, freeciv-sound-* for sound packs, freeciv-tile-* for tile
      packages, freeciv-client-* for client packages.
    - move arch-independent data to freeciv-data, freeciv to freeciv-server
      and make freeciv a dummy package, which depends on freeciv-client and
      freeciv-server to ensure smooth upgrades. In Sarge+1, this package will
      be removed and made a virtual package, provided by freeciv-clients.
    - NOTE: if you just want a freeciv client and not the server, you'll
      have to manually remove the freeciv-server and freeciv packages.
  * debian/README.Debian:
    + add a note about customizing the look of GTK2 clients (closes: #187912).
    + add some explanations on the package reorganization.
  * debian/control:
    + freeciv: made a dummy package which depends on freeciv-server and
      freeciv-client.
    + freeciv-server:
      - new package, including just the server binary.
      - Depends: freeciv-data, Suggests: freeciv-client, Conflicts: old
        freeciv packages.
    + freeciv-xaw3d:
      - renamed to freeciv-client-xaw3d.
      - make freeciv-xaw3d a dummy package which just depends on
        freeciv-client-xaw3d.
      - Depends: freeciv-data, Suggests: freeciv-server, freeciv-sound,
        Provides: freeciv-client, freeciv-xaw3d, Replaces: freeciv-xaw3d.
    + freeciv-gtk: same as freeciv-xaw3d.
    + freeciv-data: new package, including arch-independent data files.
    + add Filip Van Raemdonck <mechanix@debian.org> to Uploaders:.
  * debian/freeciv.desktop: add StartupNotify support.
  * debian/rules:
    + add binary-indep rules.
    + install everything in debian/tmp and then use dh_install.
    + use $localedir on install rules instead of moving mo files later.
    + install freeciv.desktop in the GNOME2/KDE3-compatible location.
    + lots of other cruft cleaning.
  * debian/freeciv-{client-gtk,client-xaw3d,server}.links:
    + link /usr/share/doc dirs to freeciv-data's.
    + manage manpage symlinks here.
  * debian/watch: rewrite using v2 format, correct path to tarballs.
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/graphics.c: backport a working fix for the
    Gdk-CRITICAL warnings on resizing the Freeciv logo (closes: #180138).
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/cityrep.c: backport fix from CVS to fix a city report
    update segfault (closes: #190140).
  * client/gui-gtk-2.0/Freeciv.h: change chatline default colours to black
    on white, to make it more readable (1.14.1 will behave like this too).

freeciv (1.14.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

    + don't lie, and really add autotools-dev to Build-Depends.
    + apply Filip Van Raemdonck's suggestions to enhance the descriptions
      (closes: #177859).
  * debian/rules: define HAVE_LIBXAW3D by hand on build-xaw, to work around a
    bug where Xaw3D wouldn't be included at compile time, making civclient-xaw
    segfault immediatelly on startup.
  * The "Learned New Tech" message has been configurable for a few versions
    (closes: #48023).
  * The "Turn done" button obeys the GTK theme with GTK2 (closes: #127048).
  * The package correctly removes alternatives (closes: #176113).

freeciv (1.14.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * New maintainer. Thanks Jules!
  * Rebuild tarball to exclude upstream debian/ dir.

    + updated Maintainer: field.
    + tighten client Depends to (>= 1.14.0).
    + improve package synopsis, which makes lintian happy.

    + Standards-Version: 3.5.8.0.
  * debian/compat: use DH_COMPAT=4.
  * debian/docs: add a list of individual docs, don't just glob, as there's
    stuff we don't want at all.
  * debian/rules:
    + pass DEB_HOST_GNU_TYPE and DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE to the configure call.
    + symlink config.sub and config.guess to those provided by autotools-dev
      on configure, rm them on clean.
    + add support for DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
    + remove DH_COMPAT definition.
    + add --enable-client arguments to build-gtk and build-xaw3d.
    + other build fixes.
  * Not applying Wonders of the World patch, as there's no testing of how
    non-patched clients/servers would react to this (closes: #153018).
  * Maintainer release, closing NMU fixed bugs (closes: #170901, #47352,

freeciv (1.13.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-Maintainer Upload, after trying to contact Jules with no luck.
  * This release was cooked up by Filip Van Raemdonck and Jordi Mallach,
    in an amazing lesson of cooperation.
  * New upstream version, which works with online servers (closes: #154329).
  * Correct the description (closes: #124640).
  * Install the upstream changelog only once (closes: #140618).
  * Remove the emacs variables from this changelog.
  * Remove the debian/obsolete/ directory.
  * Build with GTK+ 2.0. This means gdk-imlib-dev is no longer needed. Update
    Build-Depends:.
    Remove unneeded include of gdk_imlib.h.
  * Update Standards-Version:.
  * Update the client packages to depend on freeciv >= 1.13.
  * Set DH_COMPAT=3 to allow globbing for doc/*.
    Install the server and data files into debian/freeciv/ since compatibility
    level 3 expects them there.
    Use dh_installman instead of dh_installmanpages.
  * Don't install HOWTOPLAY into the freeciv package twice.
  * The repeated sentence has been fixed in this version (closes: #108385).
  * Fixes and additions for the .desktop file (closes: #153413).
  * Compress game scenarios (closes: #113499).
  * Not applying patch in #153018, letting Jules decide. I (Jordi) think it's
    a bad idea, not knowing how it'll look when playing in a non-Debian
    server.
  * Remove po/nl.gmo in clean so it builds ok the second time.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Aug 2002 21:18:06 +0200

freeciv (1.12.0-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload with Jules' permission.
  * New upstream version. Fixes a memory leak in the xaw3d
    client, and an issue with the Colosseum help. As far as I can tell the goto
    bug report is also fixed.
    (Closes: #24037, #88539, #100768, #106283, #108038)
  * Increase Standards-Version.
  * Add Build-Depends. (Closes: #68964, #92096)
  * Add alternatives for civclient, not only civ. (Closes: #47352, #71276)
  * Add readline support. (Closes: #94492)
  * Remove kludge for pot files not getting installed; add another one for pot
    files getting installed in the wrong location.
  * Move freeciv-{gtk,xaw3d}.postrm to .prerm for update-alternatives.
  * Bump server package version in clients dependencies.
    (Closes: #94486, #95203)
  * Remove xaw3dg from Depends: in control for freeciv-xaw3d; dh_shlibdeps
    takes care of this. (Closes: #94485)
  * Add --without-zlib to the clients configure calls so it doesn't get linked
    in (clients don't need it). (Closes: #94487, #94488)
  * Fix typo in nl translation.
  * Go through bugs and weed out the already fixed ones. (Closes: #47352)
  * Yay! I got more bugs fixed as Thorsten did (15 vs. 16).

freeciv (1.9.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non maintainer upload.
  * Make the client packages depend on freeciv >= 1.9 (closes: #49667).
  * Disabled building of the empty freeciv-xaw package which made no sense.
  * Added --cache-file option to configure invocations to speed up the
    build process.
  * Installed HOWTOPLAY into each package since it is quite small compared
    to the overall size of the software (closes: #36091).
  * Made the whole beast FHS compliant (closes: #49506).
  * Installed changelog into each package (lintian).
  * Made a doc directory for each package.
  * Removed icon="none" from menu files (lintian).
  * Added #DEBHELPER# to install/remove scripts.
  * Removed calls to update-menus from scripts because debhelper already
    takes care of this and there is a small time penalty on (de)installation.
  * Updated location of GPL license in copyright file.
  * Made civ.1.gz a slave of civ so that man civ will work (closes: 47352)
  * Checked old bug reports:
    - Help window stays after reconnecting (closes: #48016)
    - /usr/games/civ is not any longer a script but maintained by the
      alternatives system (closes: #25589)
    - civclient-gtk is dynamically linked (closes: #48017). Probably the
      problem was the result of a defect GTK installation during the
      build.
    - according to the logs, bug 26795 was fixed upstream (closes: #26795)
    - resizing does not produce any gaps with the current version
      (closes: #26797)
    - dh_clean takes care of removing debian/files (closes: #32780)
    - Debian unstable version is current (closes: #38980, #48221)
  * As the freeciv-xaw package is no longer build it can't have a bug *eg*
    - the bad link is not anymore (closes: #48214)
    - update-xaw-wrappers is not needed/called anymore (closes: #24108)
    - another problem with xaw is a non-issue (closes: #26396)
    - We do not care for alternatives vs. xaw-wrappers anymore (closes: #31907)
    - The new xaw-wrappers config format does not tangle us (closes: #37111)
    - Non-existent civclient-xaw will not segfault ;) (closes: #38368)

    snapshots). The xaw client is moved to the freeciv-xaw package.

freeciv (1.7.2-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed lots of glitches in debianization of the new status quo:
    + We no longer need the "civ" script because we now set datadir in
      configure
    + Made "civ" into an alternative, to cope with future binary packages
      freeciv-xaw3d and freeciv-gtk
    + The menu entry for the client does not point to "civ" anymore but to
      "civclient"; changed the label to state that it's the "(traditional
      Athena version)"
    + Manually stripping binaries till I get around to rewrite debian/rules
      for debhelper
  * Notice: 1.7.2-1 wouldn't work at all, if you have it you need to upgrade
