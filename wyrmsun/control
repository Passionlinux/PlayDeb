Description: Strategy game based on history, mythology and fiction (data files)
 In the Wyrmsun universe a myriad of inhabited planets exist. Humans dwell on
 Earth, while dwarves inhabit Nidavellir and elves nourish the world of
 Alfheim. These peoples struggle to carve a place for themselves with their
 tools of stone, bronze and iron. And perhaps one day they will meet one
 another, beyond the stars...
