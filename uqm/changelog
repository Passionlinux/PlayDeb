  * New upstream release. Closes: #404152
    - Featuring networked Super Melee!
    - Now usable on 64 bit systems. Closes: #350129
  * Now needs a build dep on libmikmod2-dev.
  * In this version, documentation, excluding documentation that is
    "part of the code or otherwise clearly governed" by the license of the
    code, is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 license.
    Since that license is not DFSG free, this documentation has been stripped
    from the source tarball. I'm considering the README, changelog, etc, to
    be clearly part of the code, but docs in sc2/doc/devel and sc2/doc/users
    (including the manual) are not, and thus appear to be licensed under the CC
    license now, and are removed.
  * Removed text in the man page that was originally copied from the manual.
    Sigh.
  * Updated the man page to document new options.

uqm (0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Taking over the package to get it into Debian.
  * Removed the uqm-all package. As it depends on packages that will not be
    in the main Debian archive, it's not useful and indeed was blocking
    uqm from being accepted.
  * Added a pointer to README.Debian about the uqm.debian.net apt repository.
  * Minor rules file changes.
  * Update copyright, control files.
  * Don't include empty NEWS file.
  * Mention Star Control II in the package description, and also super melee.
  * build/unix/build.sh has bashisms, so always run it using bash.
