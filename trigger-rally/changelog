trigger (0.5.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Stefan Potyra ]
  * Removed the workaround patch for directly reading from files
    instead of using the libphysfs-layer.
  * Add a patch to src/pengine/physfs_rw.cpp to fix seeking.
    Thus any data or plugin can be loaded from zip files again
    (closes: #379372).
  * Add a note how to install plugins in README.Debian.
  * Properly patch the interaction between freealut and physfs, thus
    sound files can also be loaded from zip plugins again.
  * debian/patches: split up patches against the build system from
    patches against the sourcecode.

trigger (0.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Eddy Petrişor ]
  * Added Romanian translation to desktop file

  [ Stefan Potyra ]
  * Initial release (closes: #270405).
  * Patched src/glew/Jamfile to fix up include directory.
  * Took Reinhard Tartler's patch to configure.ac which adds support
    for libalut-dev. Reran autotools to make it work.
  * Ported src/pengine/audio.{cpp|h} to new freealut semantics, as the
    compatibility functions won't work any longer.
  * Patched src/pengine/texture.cpp to not use physfs's file structure
    any longer, but rather only the filename from it, since it breaks
    when loading images otherwise.
