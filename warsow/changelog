    reduced latency and the amount of context switches.

    .pk3 files.
    + Restricted downloads of binary modules and "pure" content to official
    Warsow web mirror.

    + Pressing Escape key during the map load or connection set-up will now
    cancel the process much quicker.
    + New high resolution "flat" icon.

    'item_regen' item.
    - New map: wda5.
    - More detailed wdm5.
    - Server browser has sorting now. However, this needs a manual UI .pk3

    (place to basewsw).

    userinfo.
    - Memory leak in linear allocator.
    - Negative values of Demojump break POV change.
    - Mitigated problems with serverbrowser performance.

    * Gameplay balancing to clean up some rushy problems, most of which
    originated from weak ammo removal:
    - RL: -100ups +50ms reload.
    - RG: +5dmg per blast.
    - GL: -20 splash +50ms reload.
    - PG: -1dmg per cell and -200ups.
