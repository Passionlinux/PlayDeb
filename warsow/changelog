     + Bugfix: builtin HTTP server now accepts URL-encoded resource URI's in
     queries.
     + Improvement: faster map loading times.
    - Renderer:
     + Feature: use binary cache for GLSL programs to improve startup time
     (cvar "gl_ext_get_program_binary", off by default).
     + Feature: asynchronous texture loader (cvar "r_multithreading", off by
     default).
     + Improvement: a lightweight GLSL shader is now used for simple
     materials with no normalmap, gloss or decals.
    - Sound:

     + Bugfixes.
    - Windows:

     + Improvement: gamma ramp size can now take values up to 4096.

warsow (1.03-1~getdeb1) precise; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
    * New stuff:
    - Higher-poly health models.
    - Regeneration powerup. Mappers can add this in radiant by adding
    'item_regen' item.
    - New map: wda5.
    - More detailed wdm5.
    - Server browser has sorting now. However, this needs a manual UI .pk3
    update, download it
    http://update.warsow.net/autoupdate/1.03/basewsw/ui_porkui_003.pk3
    (place to basewsw).
    - Meat gibs removed, cg_gibs values bigger than 1 now increase amount of
    pixel gibs.

    * Fixed stuff:
    - /whois -1 crashes the server.
    - Users can workaround the banlist by supplying two ip addresses in the
    userinfo.
    - Memory leak in linear allocator.
    - Negative values of Demojump break POV change.
    - Mitigated problems with serverbrowser performance.

    * Gameplay balancing to clean up some rushy problems, most of which
    originated from weak ammo removal:
    - RL: -100ups +50ms reload.
    - RG: +5dmg per blast.
    - GL: -20 splash +50ms reload.
    - PG: -1dmg per cell and -200ups.
    - MG: +10dps.
    - Bomb has 5 less nades, from 15 to 10.
