Description: Marathon Infinity
 Marathon Infinity takes the closed universe of the Marathon
 series and blows it wide open. The solo/co-op campaign,
 "Blood Tides of Lh'owon," is a 20-level scenario sporting new
 textures, weapons, and aliens. More than that, the scenario sheds
 a surprising new light on the story's characters and the
 meaning of events. Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakening
 the ancient remnants of the S'pht, the player now faces a
 world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems...
 .
 Marathon Infinity is the most popular Marathon game in online play,
 and is compatible with hundreds of community-made maps.
 This release includes the classic graphics, and revamped high-definition
 textures and weapons.
