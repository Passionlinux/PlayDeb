megamek (0.38.0-1~getdeb1) trusty; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version
    + Data: Unit and Image Fixes
    + Data: Broken Cadaver image link
    + Bug [#4156]: Searchlights not properly added if searchlight quirk is
    added in lobby
    + Bug: MegaMekGUI was looking for readme's in the wrong location (they're
    in docs now)
    + Bug: startup.sh not properly handling documentation: it would symlink
    the data directory and copy over the readme's.  The readme's moved to the
    docs dir, but this behavior would break all of the other docs.  I added
    code to symlink the docs directory in the same fashion as the data dir.

    2765 series.
    + Data:Fixes to previous commit.
    + Made instructions for saving custom Princess configs under new names
    explicit in the Princess help file.
